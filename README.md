# Sophon Scattered Distribution 0.1

We introduced Sophon Token(SPT)), a standard ERC20-Complaiant Token with built-in convertibility directly through the smart contracts. To implement Superstring Sophon Mainnet(SSM), there might be several pre stages of Sophon Scattered Distributions(SSD), we assume every of them is crucial and thus unavoidable. Early term contributors would have a much preferable discounting rate of purchasing tokens on the future deployed Sophon mainnet.
And to solve the problem of liquidity and price discovery without any third or even second party, SPT utilizes an innovative token "Connector" method to enable formulaic price-calculation and continuous liquidity to/from all tokens, without needing to match two parties in a centralized exchange. Thus sophon tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. Details about SPT economics and future discussions related with decentralized exchanges would be disclosed in the Superstring Scattered Distribution Blackpaper and Superstring Decentralized Economics Blackpaper.
